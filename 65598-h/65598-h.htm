<p><span class="smcap">The</span> modern ‘Corner’ is unlike that into which
the historical John Horner, Esq., retired, in this
respect, that those who venture into one seldom
succeed in bringing out a plum or anything else
but discomfiture. They may plunge not only
their thumbs but their whole hands and arms
into the ‘pie’ they essay to monopolise; but as a
rule, with almost no exceptions, they have to
draw back empty-handed.</p>

<p>The word ‘Corner’ in its commercial application
is of American origin, and along with that
other mysterious word ‘Syndicate,’ is doubtless
sufficiently perplexing to non-commercial readers.
The prominence and the frequency of the appearance
of both words in the newspapers indicate
a strange commercial tendency of the day. That
tendency is to amalgamate the hazardous element
of speculation with the legitimate fabric of steady
industry. Once upon a time, speculators formed
a distinct class, apart from sober merchants and
plodding manufacturers. They had their uses;
for none but shallow thinkers will dismiss speculation
in one general sweep as immoral and evil;
but they were a distinctly marked class by themselves;
not distinctly marked, perhaps, to the
outer world, but clearly enough defined for those
engaged in commercial pursuits. But now there
exists no such definite line of demarcation. The
speculative element enters into every branch of
trade industry; and by the speculative element
we do not mean the perfectly legitimate exercise
of foresight or experience which enables a business
man to anticipate events which raise or depress
the market values of the commodities in which
he is interested, but the desire and attempt to
be the motor, or one of the motors, in such movements.
It is one thing to buy heavily of a
commodity because your instinct or your information
or your experience teaches you that a
comparative scarcity, and consequent dearness, of
the commodity will shortly occur. It is quite
another thing to buy up a commodity for the
purpose of creating a scarcity for your own
benefit. It is one thing, again, to sell out as
quickly as you can such stocks as you hold of
a commodity which you see reason to think will
be depressed in value later on. It is another
thing to sell in advance a commodity which you
do not possess, in the hope of buying it cheaper;
or to sell out heavily what you do possess, in
order to frighten others to sell also, that you
may buy back again at a still lower price than
you sold.</p>

<p>There must always be some amount of speculation
in every department of commerce and
industry. The shipbuilder, for instance, must to
some extent speculate on a continuance or otherwise
of the level of wages, or of the prices of
iron, at the time he makes a contract for a
vessel. The manufacturer who buys a quantity
of raw cotton must speculate on the
chances of the market enabling him to sell the
products of the cotton when manufactured. The
merchant must speculate on the solvency of his
buyers, and his sellers even, when he concurrently
buys and sells a cargo of goods. And so on all
through the gamut of commerce. But these
are the ordinary daily risks of trade, which it is
the business of a trader to estimate and provide
for. Quite other is the form of a speculation of
modern development. We do not say it is of
modern origin, for men have not varied very
much either in character or in practice since
commerce began; but its development is modern,
and its application is modern.</p>

<p>This modern phase has made current two
curious words—‘Corner’ and ‘Syndicate.’ The
latter is of Latin origin, and was not unknown
in old-world commerce. Then it meant the
combination of a number of merchants for the
consummation of a venture beyond the means
or the inclinations of any one of them. The
Dutch merchants were fond of forming syndicates
for large trading purposes; and the East India
Company, Hudson’s Bay Company, and many
other concerns of our own time which have now
attained the dimensions and the dignity of public
corporations, had a similar origin. The syndicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">{290}</span>
system had in it the germ of the joint-stock
Company system; but although each member
subscribed a certain amount, which he would
advance, or for which he would be liable, his
liability could not always be restricted thereto.
The uncertainty in this respect evolved the
limited liability principle now so common. But
the syndicates of to-day are of somewhat different
character; they are usually combinations of capitalists
to bring about changes in the markets
for commodities or stocks for a specific purpose.
In this manner they are the parents of
‘Corners.’</p>

<p>The word Corner is probably also of Latin
origin. It suggests <i>cornu</i>, a horn—a thing which
terminates in an angle, where is a secret and
retired place. The phrase ‘To make a Corner,’
however, is one of purely American origin, and
it is suggestive enough. It implies the concentrating
of some object into a limited area, from
which there shall be but one egress, of which
the Cornerers hold the key. It suggests something
like the gathering of a Highland sheep-farm,
where the animals are irresistibly driven
in from widely distributed spots to one small
‘fank.’ It suggests the bag or drawer of the
thrifty housewife, into which is gathered all actually
or potentially useful articles. It suggests
the commonplace book of the wide-reading and
much-writing journalist. It suggests also the old
teapot, the lucky stocking, and the Savings-bank.
But it is different from all these.</p>

<p>For there are two kinds of Corners, in the commercial
sense. There is the Corner into which
you may drive others, and the Corner into which
you may retire yourself. Of the former, the best
illustration we can recall is that of the operation
in the Stock of the Hannibal and St Joseph Railroad,
which took place in New York a year or so
ago. Certain astute and light-principled men in
Wall Street became aware that another habitué
of the same circle was selling this Stock rather
heavily, in the belief that it was too high, and
would soon be lower. In short, he was doing
what in the lingo of the mart is called ‘bearing.’
The railroad is a small one, and the amount of
Stock comparatively small. It was easy enough,
therefore, for a few of his competitors to form a
‘syndicate’ to buy up all the stock in existence,
so that when the period came for the seller to
implement his sales, the wherewithal was unobtainable
except from them. We need scarcely say
that the operators in the Stock markets daily buy
and sell securities which they intend neither to take
nor to give; they merely propose to take or to pay
the difference in price which may exist at a certain
future day of settlement. But it is always in the
option of a buyer to insist on the delivery of the
actual stock, if he really wants it; and then the
seller must provide it, at whatever cost. The
cunning buyers of the Hannibal stock did not
want it, and indeed they paid for much of it far
beyond its real value, because every purchase they
made raised its price in the market. What they
wanted was to place the original seller, or ‘bear,’
in a Corner; and this they effectually did. They
forced up the price to, let us say, three hundred
dollars—we forget the exact figures, but they are
immaterial—of what the seller had sold at, say,
ninety dollars. And worse than that, when the
day of settlement came, the seller could not obtain
stock at any price whatever. He was completely
‘cornered,’ and had eventually to pay the difference
which the keen ‘bulls’ chose to exact. But
with the sequel comes the moral. Having exacted
all they could out of the unfortunate seller, they
found <i>themselves</i> in a Corner. They were possessed
of a quantity of Stock which they did not
want, and which nobody else wanted at anything
like the prices they had paid for it. They had to
sell, and with every sale the price came tumbling
down, so that ultimately, we believe, their loss
upon their own purchases exceeded considerably
what they had extracted from the poor man they
put in ‘a Corner.’</p>

<p>Then there is the Corner into which you go
yourself. Messrs John Horner and Company of
Chicago form the impression that, let us say,
pigs’ bristles might, could, would, or should
advance in price. They determine that bristles
shall; and set to work to buy all they can lay
their hands on, and to contract for future delivery
of as much as they can get any one to sell. Of
course, the price advances, and this the more
rapidly in proportion as their purchases extend;
but the unfortunate thing—for them—is, that
they are themselves the principal, if not the sole,
purchasers at the enhanced rates. By-and-by they
become the masters of all, or nearly all, the available
supply of pigs’ bristles; they have ‘made a
Corner,’ and in the American phraseology, they
‘control’ the market. But markets are rather
unmanageable affairs, after all, as Messrs John
Horner and Company find when they have to
realise in order to pay for their later purchases;
or when, if they have been rich enough to pay
and lie out of the money, they want to realise
their profit.</p>

<p>The effect is still more pronounced when the
Corner is attempted in one of the staples of
commerce, such as wheat or cotton, the supplies
of which are not confined to one spot, and are
practically illimitable. For such huge Corners
as these, combinations of several firms are
needed in order to provide the money; and
the reverse, when it comes, is therefore more
widespread and disastrous. The Wheat Corner
in Chicago, at the beginning of 1882, was a
remarkable instance of audacity and also of recklessness
in this species of speculation; and the
effects of the tremendous collapse have not yet
worn off. A still more recent example was the
Lard Corner in the same city, which collapsed in
June of last year, and the sweeping out of which
brought down several firms in other parts of the
States. But we must not conclude that operations
of this kind are confined to America; we have
them in this country also; and not very long
ago, a bold and very nearly successful Corner
was made in Liverpool in cotton, which produced
a good deal of moralising and very heavy
losses.</p>

<p>It is often a delicate matter to define what
is legitimate and what is illegitimate speculation;
but of the moral aspect of Corners there can
be little doubt. They are bold and entirely selfish
attempts to produce artificial scarcity, to the
prejudice of the many, and for the benefit of the
few. They essay to overset the operation of the
inevitable and just law of supply and demand.
They are therefore wrong in morals, and false
in economics. They are not examples of trading,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">{291}</span>
in the proper meaning of the term; they are
merely specimens of inordinate gambling. They
disorganise commerce, because they divert streams
of commodities from ordinary channels, which it
has taken the labour of years to create; and they
disorganise finance, by deranging the exchanges
between countries, through the concentration of
commodities and money which should be circulating.
Their immediate effect is to inflict a
large loss upon the commercial centres, not only
directly of the countries in which they occur,
but also indirectly upon other countries. This
is readily capable of demonstration, but is too
technical a question to enter upon here.</p>

<p>In the old days of British commerce, the
practice called ‘forestalling’ was a penal offence.
Forestalling is defined by M’Culloch as ‘the
buying or contracting for any cattle, provision,
or merchandise on its way to the market, or
dissuading persons from sending their goods there,
or persuading them to raise the price, or spreading
any false rumour with intent to enhance the
value of any article.’ The penalties enacted by
various statutes were very severe; but they were
repealed in 1772. There was also a practice
described in the old statutes as ‘engrossing,’ which
meant simply the buying up of corn and other
provisions in order to raise the prices thereof.
Although the Acts referring to this practice were
repealed, we believe that ‘engrossing’ is still an
indictable offence at common law. As a matter
of fact, however, no indictment is ever made,
and if made, no conviction would ever follow.
In his exhaustive article on the Corn-laws, Mr
M’Culloch showed very ably how the speculations
of merchants who buy up corn in times of
abundance react to the benefit of the community
in times of scarcity; and how in times of scarcity
similar speculations operate to prevent waste and
to induce economy. But there is some considerable
difference between the operations referred
to by M’Culloch and those which we have under
review just now.</p>

<p>The unwholesome effects of Corners, and the
dangerous features they lend to commerce, are
so powerfully felt in the United States, that
the legislative bodies of the States of Illinois
and New York—States where the evil is most
prevalent—have been seriously considering how
to counteract them. Each assembly had before
it a Bill for rendering these operations illegal,
and punishable by heavy penalties. It is exceedingly
doubtful, however, if either of the Bills
will ever become law; and it is not by any
means manifest that legislation on the subject is
desirable. The hand of the law is rarely interposed
to stay the stream of commerce without
producing more evils than it seeks to prevent.
That stream often gets into muddy and unhealthy,
even dangerous channels; but it has
a recuperative power within itself greater than
any which can be applied extraneously. The
moral effects of Corners are bad upon all engaged
in them, and they inflict hardship and loss
upon many innocent people, as a consequence
of the solidarity of all social affairs. The commercial
effects also are bad, as we have shown;
and herein lies the chief hope of reform. We
cannot recall a single instance of a Corner—and
we have been acquainted with the inner history
of a good many of the species—which did not
result in overthrow and disaster, sooner or later,
to those in it. Either the operation attempted
is too gigantic for the means at command; or
success in the first steps feeds the appetite for
gain, and blinds the operators to the attendant
risks, so that they go too far; or they become
timid, and do not go far enough. In the glow
of extensive buying, the effects of the ultimate
sales are always under-estimated. The object of
a Corner is to buy in order to sell at some
future time; and when the selling begins, the
downfall of prices is always more rapid than the
advance, and then the Corner is swept clean not
only of the commodities, but also of those who
put them in. And as there is about almost every
evil some germ of good, we must not forget that
the effect of a Corner is often to stimulate supplies
of the commodity ‘cornered,’ in other regions,
and the world is benefited by the increase of productive
wealth. This, however, is an accident,
and in no way justifies the creation of Corners,
which are dark, malodorous, unhealthy, and altogether
detestable features in the commercial structure.
Public opinion, and the conviction that not
only will he not bring out a plum, but that also
he may possibly have to leave his skin behind
him, will ultimately, we hope, have more effect
in keeping the modern John Horner out of a
Corner, than legislative enactment is likely to
do.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.—WHY IS SHE SO?</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> never was a man who felt more buoyant
on learning that his name had been set down in
a will for a handsome legacy than Philip felt on
learning that he had been cut out of one. First,
it was the right thing to do: he was sure of that,
the circumstances considered; next, it had helped
to render this interview, which he had expected
to be so painful, a pleasant one. Thus he was
enabled to speed with a gay heart to Madge,
carrying the happy tidings, that in spite of the
awkward position he occupied between his uncle
and father, he seemed to be more in accord with
the latter, and certainly much more in his confidence,
than he had been at any previous
time.</p>

<p>He took a short-cut through the Forest—the
way was too well known to him for him to lose
it; and besides, the evening was not dark to his
young eyes, although some black flying clouds
helped the skeleton trees to make curious silhouettes
across his path. Then swiftly down
by the river-side, catching glimpses of stars flickering
in the rippling water, and his steps keeping
time to its patter, as it broke upon the stones or
bulging sedges.</p>

<p>As he was crossing the stile at the foot of the
meadow, he caught the sound of whispering voices
from the direction of the ‘dancing beeches.’ A
lovers’ tryst, no doubt, and the voices were very
earnest. He smiled, and quickened his pace
without looking back. He, too, was a lover.</p>

<p>At the house he found Aunt Hessy alone in
the oak parlour, where the customary substantial
tea was laid, instead of in the ordinary living-room.
That was suggestive of company. Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">{292}</span>
Hessy had on her Sunday cap and gown. That
also was suggestive of company.</p>

<p>‘Going to have some friends with you to-night?’
he said gaily.</p>

<p>‘Thou art a friend, and here,’ she answered,
with her quiet welcoming smile; ‘but I do expect
another—that is, Mr Beecham.’</p>

<p>‘What! you have persuaded the shy gentleman
to become your guest at last? Do you know how
I account for his shyness?—he saw you at church,
and fell in love with you. That’s how it is, and
he won’t come here because he was afraid of you.
Lovers are always shy—at first.’</p>

<p>‘Thou art a foolish lad, Philip, and yet no
shining example of the shyness of lovers. Were
they all like thee, no maiden would lose a sweetheart
for lack of boldness on his part. Art not
ashamed?’</p>

<p>‘I am, Aunt Hessy,’ he answered with his
boyish laugh, ‘ashamed that you cannot understand
how we are all your lovers—and ought
to be.’</p>

<p>‘That will do.’ But although she spoke with
much decision in her tone, there was no displeasure
in her comely face. She understood
him.</p>

<p>‘I won’t say another word, except to ask you
how you have conquered Mr Beecham?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but we are not sure that we have conquered
him yet. He was with Dick this morning,
and gave him some help with the cattle. Dick
is in the barn with them now, for he is afraid
there’s trouble coming to them.’</p>

<p>‘And I suppose he is angrier than ever about
the live-stock brought into the market from
abroad?’</p>

<p>‘It is making him anxious, and with reason.
Well, he wanted his friend to come and take
dinner; but Mr Beecham said he would rather
come in some evening soon and take tea with
us. So, in the afternoon I sent Madge off to the
village, and bade her <i>make</i> him come this evening.
I don’t know what’s come of her. She’s been
away more than three hours, and she is not one
to loiter on the road.’</p>

<p>‘Which way do you think they’ll come?’ asked
Philip, rising quickly from his seat.</p>

<p>‘By the meadows, of course. She never comes
round by the road except when driving.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll go and meet them.’</p>

<p>But before he could move, they heard the front-door
open.</p>

<p>‘That’s her,’ said the dame, gladly expectant.</p>

<p>Madge entered the parlour alone; and Philip
was surprised to note that she seemed to be a
little startled by something—his presence perhaps.
Next, he was surprised to note that she looked
pale and excited.</p>

<p>‘Thou hast not persuaded our friend to come
to us, then,’ said the dame, disappointed, and not
observing Madge so closely as Philip.</p>

<p>‘Has anything happened Madge?—What has
frightened you?’ he said quickly, taking her
hands and gazing into her eyes.</p>

<p>‘Nothing has frightened me, Philip,’ she
answered hurriedly, and with a remote sign of
irritability at her present condition being noticed.
‘I have been running up the meadows, and
I daresay I am flushed a little.’</p>

<p>‘Flushed!—Why, you are as white as if you
had seen a ghost.’</p>

<p>‘Well, perhaps I have seen a ghost. Would
you like to go and look for it?’</p>

<p>She withdrew her hands and went to her
aunt.</p>

<p>Philip stood still, surprised and puzzled, and
a little distressed. It was such a new experience
to see Madge nervous and irritable—she who was
always so calm and clear-sighted when other
people lost their heads—that he did not know
what to make of it. And then there was such
impatience in the way she had snapped up what
he considered a very natural remark for any one
who looked at her steadily for a moment. Her
eyes had not met his in the usual clear, trustful
way: they seemed to avoid his gaze, and she had
turned from him as if he annoyed her! Why
was she so?</p>

<p>‘I had to wait some time for Mr Beecham,
aunt,’ Madge said. Her voice was husky, and
unlike any sound Philip had heard her produce
before. ‘Then we were talking a long time
together, and that is what has made me so late.
He says he cannot come this evening. I told
him how much you wished him to come, and he
said he would have liked very much to do so,
but could not.... I am afraid I have caught
a cold.... I did my best to get him to come,
but he would not.... My head is aching, aunt;
I think I shall go up-stairs.’</p>

<p>The dame was now as much surprised as Philip
by the curious manner of her niece; but she did
not show it. She lifted off the girl’s hat, passed
her hand gently over the hot brow, and said
soothingly: ‘Yes, child, you had better go up-stairs;
and I will come to you in a few minutes.
I don’t believe you have changed your boots since
the morning. Go up-stairs at once.’</p>

<p>‘I will try and come down again, Philip,’ she
said, tenderly touching his arm as she passed, to
console him for that little irritability.</p>

<p>‘All right, Madge; I’ll wait,’ he answered
cheerfully.</p>

<p>She passed out, and there was a yelping of
dogs heard at the same time. In rushed Dash
and Rover and Tip, followed by their master.</p>

<p>‘I am as hungry as a hawk, mother, and so
are the dogs,’ exclaimed Uncle Dick, after saluting
Philip. ‘I can’t wait for anybody.—Sit down,
lad, and eat.’</p>

<p>The dame served them, and then quietly left
the room.</p>

<p>Philip ate, and heard Uncle Dick speaking
as if from a far distance; but all the time he
was perpetually asking himself—‘Why is she
so?’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUICIDE">SUICIDE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> term ‘suicide’ is almost universally applied
to all acts of self-destruction, and equally indiscriminately
to all perpetrators thereof, no distinction
being made as to their state of mind at
the time of killing themselves. It is in this
popularly understood sense that we have used
the word throughout this article. From a legal
point of view, however, the term can only be
correctly employed to denote the self-murder
(<i>felonia de se</i>) of a sane and legally responsible
person. A lunatic cannot in a legal sense commit
suicide, though he may destroy himself. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">{293}</span>
suicide, or <i>felo de se</i>, is in the eye of the law
a criminal, and was formerly ‘punished’ by
being buried at midnight at the meeting of four
cross-roads, a stake being driven through the
body. Since 1823, this <i>post mortem</i> punishment
has been limited to simple interment at night
in unconsecrated ground without any of the
rites of Christian burial; and even this has but
seldom to be carried out, owing to the charity,
and perhaps also to the want of knowledge,
of coroners’ juries, who generally find that the
act has been committed during a fit of temporary
insanity.</p>

<p>Among the ancients, suicide was very frequently
resorted to, sometimes for the most trivial reasons,
and was considered part of their code of religion
and honour. By the Romans especially, it was
regarded quite in the light of a national custom,
and by their laws a man was justified in killing
himself when worn out by lasting pain or lingering
disease, or burdened with a load of debt, or
even from sheer weariness of life (<i>tædium vitæ</i>).
His will was valid; and if intestate, his heirs
succeeded him. Among the illustrious individuals
of former times who quitted this world
voluntarily and prematurely, we find the names
of Demosthenes, Antony and Cleopatra, Cato,
Hannibal, Cassius and Brutus, and many others.
Suicide was looked upon as a cardinal virtue
by the Stoics, whose founder, Zeno, hanged
himself at the ripe old age of ninety-eight. The
custom was also highly commended by Lucretius
and the Epicureans. The philosophers of old
spoke of it as ‘a justifiable escape from the
miseries of life;’ and as ‘the greatest indulgence
given to man;’ Diogenes even going so
far as to declare that ‘the nearer to suicide the
nearest to virtue.’</p>

<p>The ideas of the ancients concerning this
practice underwent a great change after the
time of Constantine the Great, with the advancement
of the Christian religion, which has always
discouraged suicide, and regarded it as one of
the degrees of murder. During the middle
ages, when religious sentiment was predominant,
instances of self-destruction were few and far
between, these few being mostly caused by the
monotony of monastic life; but with the Renaissance
was revived a modified form of Stoicism,
with, of course, a return of suicide. In More’s
<i>Utopia</i>, the inhabitants of the happy republic,
when, from sickness or old age, they are become
a burden to themselves and to all about them,
are exhorted—but in nowise compelled—by their
priests to deliver themselves voluntarily from
their ‘prison and torture,’ or to allow others to
effect their deliverance. To the somewhat melancholy
tendency of the Elizabethan period and
the psychological studies of Shakspeare, succeeded
a long period of calm; but towards the end of
the eighteenth century began, with <i>Werther</i>—who
has been called ‘Hamlet’s posthumous
child’—the era of modern suicidal melancholy.
This differs essentially from the suicidal era of
the ancients, being psychical rather than physical.
Whereas theirs was born of sheer exhaustion and
satiety, with want of belief in a future state of
existence, that of the present day is the melancholy
of a restless and unceasingly analysing soul,
eternally brooding over the insoluble problems
‘Whence?’ and ‘Whither?’ which disordered
state not unfrequently leads to incapacity for
action, and finally to inability to live.</p>

<p>It is a very prevalent but erroneous belief that
suicide is invariably preceded by insanity. Self-destruction
is always an <i>unnatural</i> act, and a
violation of the laws of nature, but is not, therefore,
necessarily an <i>insane</i> act. On the contrary, a
large minority—some authorities say the majority—of
suicidal acts are perpetrated by persons who
cannot be called other than sane, though their
mental state is indisputably more or less abnormal
at the time, and the organic action of the brain
and nervous system sometimes in a state of excitement
bordering on real pathological irritation.
Dr Wynter affirms the suicidal impulse to be
‘an inexplicable phenomenon on the borderlands
of insanity;’ the power of the will to conquer
any impulse is the sole difference between a
healthy and an unsound mind. But self-destruction
is not, as a rule, the outcome of a mere
impulse, but an act of longer or shorter deliberation,
and brought about by some cause, which
may be either real or imaginary; and here we
have the simple test for distinguishing between
sane and insane suicides, namely, the absence or
presence of delusions. Outside of insanity, the
passions and emotions are generally at the root
of self-murder; remorse, dread of exposure and
punishment, long wearing sorrow or disease, or
hopeless poverty, are the usual causes for an act
which is generally regarded with far too great
equanimity, and occasionally even with commiseration,
being looked upon as ‘a catastrophe
rather than a crime,’ although condemned by
the religion and laws of the land. With
lunatics, the causes inciting to the act are
mainly if not wholly imaginary, or delusional;
they often fancy they hear voices perpetually
urging them to destroy themselves, and these
supposed supernatural commands they generally
obey sooner or later. Men in prosperous
circumstances have frequently been known to
make away with themselves from <i>fear</i> of poverty
and want; others have perhaps committed some
trifling act of delinquency, which they magnify
into an unpardonable offence, only to be expiated
by death. Some insane persons will kill those
dear to them, especially their own children, before
destroying themselves, probably with the view of
preserving them from so wretched a lot as they
conceive their own to be. There is usually
previous ill health and depression, with great
desire for solitude, in these cases of suicide by
the insane, many of which could be prevented by
the timely exercise of proper care and supervision,
as is clearly shown by their mostly occurring
among those lunatics who are not under proper
restraint.</p>

<p><i>Melancholia</i> is the name given to that form of
delusional insanity, or partial moral mania, which
chiefly manifests itself in a desire for self-destruction.
Hypochondriacs may be said to be in the
first stage of this, and in the first stage very fortunately
most of them remain. They feel death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">{294}</span>
would be a blessing, and are constantly talking
about killing themselves; but they are very
irresolute, and if they do summon up courage
enough to make the attempt, it is generally abortive,
and is not repeated.</p>

<p>Equally devoid of foundation is the assertion so
persistently made by foreigners, and at last almost
believed in by ourselves, that England is the land
of suicide. Frenchmen especially seem seriously
to entertain the idea that we are always ready to
blow out our brains in a fit of the spleen, caused
by our much-maligned climate, and general
dullness and lack of amusement! In point of
fact, Paris itself is the headquarters of self-destruction,
and its Morgue one of the principal
and most frequented show-places of the city.
The cases there are much more numerous in proportion
to the number of the population than in
this country, and have been variously estimated at
from three to five times as many; but there is
not the publicity afforded them in the Parisian
press that is given them by our own widely
circulated daily and weekly papers. As a proof
that climate has but little connection with the
tendency to commit suicide, it may be pointed out
that the inhabitants of damp and foggy Holland,
a ‘country that draws fifty foot of water,’ are by
no means addicted to self-slaughter. The buoyant,
light-hearted Irish are, with the exception perhaps
of the Neapolitans, the least suicidal people in
Europe.</p>

<p>In what may be designated, as compared with
European countries, the topsy-turvy nations of
China and Japan, suicide is quite an institution,
and is apparently looked upon as a fine art; so
much so, that in the latter country the sons of
people of quality exercise themselves in their
youth for five or six years, in order that they
may kill themselves, in case of need, with grace
and elegance. If a functionary of the Japanese
government has incurred disgrace, he is allowed to
put an end to his own life, which spares him the
ignominy of punishment at the hands of others,
and secures the reversion of his place to his son.
All government officials are provided with a habit
of ceremony, made of hempen cloth, necessary for
such an occasion; the sight of this garment must
serve, we should think, as a perpetual <i>memento
mori</i>, and as a warning not to stray from the
right path. As soon as the order commanding
suicide has been communicated to a culprit, he
invites his friends to a feast, and takes formal
leave of them; then, the order of the court having
been read over to him, he makes his ‘last dying
speech and confession,’ draws his sabre, and cuts
himself across the body or rips himself up, when
a confidential servant at once strikes off his head.
In China also, the regulations for self-destruction
are rigorously defined and carried out; a mandarin
who can boast of the peacock’s feather is
graciously allowed to choke himself by swallowing
gold-leaf; while one of less lofty rank, who is
only able to sport a red button on his cap, is
obliged to rest content with the permission to
strangle himself with a silken cord. In India,
the voluntary self-immolation of widows on their
deceased husbands’ funeral pyres was, until
recently, a universal practice, and still takes
place occasionally in secret, though very properly
discouraged by the government. In some parts
of the East Indies the natives vow suicide in
return for boons solicited from their idols; and
in fulfilment of this vow, fling themselves from
lofty precipices, and are dashed to pieces. Or they
will destroy themselves after having had a quarrel
with any one, in order that their blood may lie
at their adversary’s door.</p>

<p>Contrary to the generally received opinion, the
spring and summer are the seasons when suicides
most abound. The months of March, June, and
July are those chiefly affected by males for this
purpose; while females seem to prefer September,
the much-abused November, and January. The
time of day chosen for the deed is usually either
early morning or early evening. The tendency to
suicide varies with the occupation, and is said to
be twice as great among artisans as it is among
labourers; it is certainly much greater in cities
than in rural districts, and increases with the
increase of civilisation and education. The fact
that married people are much less prone to self-destruction
than the unmarried may be accounted
for by the theory of natural selection, as it is
usually, and especially with women, only the
more healthy both in mind and body who enter
the married state; while the fact of suicides
among males being always so much more numerous
than among females is perhaps to a certain extent
to be explained by the former having a wider
choice of means at their disposal, and ready at
hand. Women, as a rule, prefer to put an end
to their lives by drowning; and as they may
have to travel a long distance before being able
to accomplish their design, it is not unlikely that
they may sometimes repent and alter their minds
before their journey’s end. Again, people who
throw themselves into the water are not unfrequently
rescued before life is extinct, and restored.
Unless insane, they are probably cured by the
attempt, and will not renew it, the mind having
regained its self-control. Suicide is but rarely
met with in old people, and is also very uncommon
in children, although instances are recorded
of quite young children hanging or drowning
themselves on being reproved or punished for
some venial fault.</p>

<p>An ill-directed education and certain objectionable
descriptions of literature favour the disposition
to self-destruction. The propensity is
most strongly marked in those persons who are of
a bilious or of a nervous temperament.</p>

<p>Some would-be suicides resolve to kill themselves
in a particular way, and may have to wait
years for an opportunity; others will make use
of the first mode of destruction that presents
itself. Taylor says: ‘The sight of a weapon or
of a particular spot where a previous suicide has
been committed, will often induce a person, who
may hitherto have been unsuspected of any such
disposition, at once to destroy himself.’ Individuals
conscious of their liability to commit self-murder
would do well, therefore, to avoid that
‘sight of means to do ill deeds’ which might lead
to the ‘ill deed’ being ‘done’ in a sudden fit of
depression or frenzy.</p>

<p>The publicity afforded by newspapers to any
remarkable case of suicide, with full description
of details, has unquestionably a pernicious effect,
not only by suggesting a means to those already
predisposed to the act, but also by its tending
to lessen the natural horror of self-murder
inherent in the human mind. Example has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">{295}</span>
avowedly a great influence in exciting the propensity
to suicide; and a man who cannot
justify the rash act to his own conscience,
will find excuses for it in the examples of
others. This imitative propensity may even
amount to an epidemic, as at Versailles in 1793,
when no fewer than thirteen hundred persons
destroyed themselves. Some years ago, the
Hôtel des Invalides, Paris, was the scene of one
of these outbreaks; one of the invalids hanged
himself on a crossbar of the institution; and in
the ensuing fortnight, six or seven others followed
his example on the same bar, the epidemic being
only stopped by the governor having the passage
closed.</p>

<p>Insane people will sometimes display great ingenuity
and perseverance in the means by which
they choose to put an end to themselves. They
are very determined; and if frustrated in one
attempt, will make others, perhaps all in different
ways; and unless very strictly guarded, will generally
succeed at last in effecting their purpose.
An instance of almost incredible determination
to die is that of a French gentleman who dug
a trench in a wood and lay in it sixteen days,
writing down in a journal each day the state of
his feelings. From this journal it appeared that
he suffered greatly, at first from hunger, and
afterwards from thirst and cold. He left his
trench, and got a little water from the pump of
an inn near the wood on the sixth night; and
this he continued to do until the tenth day, when
he was too weak to stir. He ceased to write on
the fifteenth day; and on the sixteenth he was
discovered by a countryman, who tried—but in
vain—to restore him. He died on the eighteenth
day.</p>

<p>The heredity of suicide, though not universally
conceded, is admitted by most authorities, and
according to some, the tendency to self-destruction
is more disposed to be hereditary than
any other form of insanity. Certainly a great
number of those who put an end to their own
lives are members of families in which instances
of suicide or insanity have previously occurred,
and the propensity is usually most strong at some
particular age. Dr Gall mentions the case of
a Frenchman of property who killed himself,
leaving a large sum of money to be divided
among his seven children. None of these met
with any real misfortunes in life, but all
succumbed, before attaining their fortieth year,
to the mania for suicide.</p>

<p>Intemperance, the root of half the idiocy and
a considerable percentage of the insanity of the
country, is also largely contributory to the rapidly
increasing number of cases of self-murder. In
the French classification, which is ‘generally
admitted to be pretty true of all countries,’ fifteen
per cent. are put down to drink; while thirty-four
per cent. are attributed to insanity, twenty-three
per cent. to grief, and twenty-eight per
cent. to various other causes.</p>

<p>Suicide, whether regarded as a crime or a
disease, is in all cases a rash, ill-advised act of
impatience. Napoleon—who, when his misfortunes
reached a climax, declared he had not
‘enough of the Roman in him’ for suicide—described
it as an act of cowardice, a running
away from the enemy before being defeated.
Perhaps the best safeguards against it are domestic
ties and the sense of responsibility and accountability.
Very few instances of self-destruction
occur among prudent hard-working heads of
families who have insured their lives.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHEWTON-ABBOT">CHEWTON-ABBOT.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER II.">IN THREE CHAPTERS.—CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Abbot</span> drove home in her stately carriage
thinking deeply. Her mind was tolerably easy.
She knew there was little chance of a young
man’s love living through years of absence and
silence. Frank would go into the great world,
and gaze on many a fair face during that time;
till the beautiful face of Millicent Keene—for
even Mrs Abbot could not gainsay the girl’s
beauty—would gradually fade from his thoughts.
He would taste the cup of ambition; he would
see what power and station meant in the world,
and would soon laugh to scorn his boyish dream.
He would very quickly realise the difference
between Abbot of Chewton Hall and plain
Frank Abbot, who had to earn the bread to
keep a wife, be she ever so charming. In fact,
the thoughts of Mrs Abbot in her carriage and
Miss Keene on her sofa were almost identical,
although the words which expressed them
differed.</p>

<p>Save for one thing, Mrs Abbot’s reflections
were very comforting. The drawback was that
she felt lowered in her own eyes. She had made
a mistake, and had been treated with contumely.
The victory was hers, but she had not won it
herself. It was not her cleverness, but the girl’s
right-mindedness which would bring about the
separation. She blamed herself for having misread
the girl’s character, and found her honest
indignation at the imputation that her love for
Frank was influenced by his possessions, mortifying
to think of. Still, matters had turned out
well. She would have the satisfaction of telling
her husband that all was, or would be, at an end—that
the hope of the Abbots would not marry
nobody’s daughter. So busy was she with these
thoughts, that she did not notice, when some
three miles outside the smoky town of Bristol,
a horseman approaching. Upon seeing him, her
coachman gathered up the reins preparatory to
stopping his horses; but, as the rider made a
negative gesture, he simply touched his hat and
drove on; whilst Frank Abbot and his mother
passed, neither apparently noticing the other.</p>

<p>He was a handsome young fellow, and without
a cent to his name might have given many a
wealthy competitor long odds in the race for a
girl’s heart. Tall and broad-shouldered—clever
face, with deep-set eyes, large chin, and firm lips.
He sat his horse gracefully, looking every inch
a gentleman and an Englishman. Not, one would
say, the man to win a woman’s love, and throw
it aside at the bidding of father or mother. Not
the man to do a thing hastily and repent the
deed at his leisure. Rather, a man who, when
once engaged in a pursuit, would follow it steadfastly
to the end, whatever that end might be.
It was scarcely right that Millicent Keene should
allow fear to mingle with her grief at the
approaching long separation from her lover. She
should have looked into that handsome powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">{296}</span>
face and understood that years would only
mould the boy’s intention into the man’s determination.</p>

<p>Naturally, he was at the present moment rather
down-hearted. His mother, having learned his
secret, had refused him sympathy or aid. Too
well he knew she was to be swayed neither by
entreaty nor argument. He was now riding over
to Clifton to reiterate his love to Millicent, and
to consult as to future steps. As he passed the
carriage, he wondered what had brought his
mother in that direction. She had not mentioned
her intention of going to the town, nor had she
asked for his escort as usual. Could it be possible
that she had driven over to visit Millicent? If
so, he knew it boded ill; so, pricking on as fast
as he could, he reached Clifton just as the girl
had grown more calm and had washed away the
traces of her recent tears.</p>

<p>Frank was terribly upset by her recital of the
events of the morning. Although she did not
repeat the whole conversation, he knew his
mother well enough to be able to supply what
Millicent passed lightly over. The proposed
separation was a thunderstroke to him. In vain
he entreated the girl to reconsider her determination.
The promise was made, and her pride
alone would insure her keeping it. Of course
Frank vowed, after the usual manner of lovers,
that love would grow stronger in absence; and
as he thoroughly believed what he vowed, his
vows were very consoling to the girl. He declared
he also would go to Australia; marry Millicent,
and take to sheep-farming, leaving the paternal
acres to shift for themselves. All this and many
other wild things the young fellow said; but the
end was a sorrowful acquiescence in the separation,
tempered by the firm resolve of claiming
her in four years’ time in spite of any home
opposition. Having settled this, the heir of the
Abbots rode home in a state of open rebellion
against his parents.</p>

<p>This they were quite prepared for, and had,
like sensible people, made up their minds to
endure his onslaught passively. His mother
made no reply to his reproaches; his father took
no notice of his implied threats; but both longed
for the time to come when Miss Keene would
sail to distant shores and the work of supplanting
her might begin.</p>

<p>About one thing Frank was firm, and Millicent,
perhaps, did not try to dissuade him from it.
Until they were bound to part, he would see
her every day. Mr and Mrs Abbot knew why
his horse was ordered every morning, and whence
that horse bore him at eve; but they said
nothing.</p>

<p>The fatal day came soon enough. Frank went
down to Plymouth to see the very last of his
love; and the mighty steamship <i>Chimborazo</i> bore
away across the deep seas one of the sweetest
and truest girls that ever won a man’s heart. A
week after she sailed, Frank Abbot started on
his continental tour.</p>

<p>‘I don’t care much about it,’ he said to himself,
dolefully enough; ‘but it may help to make some
of the time pass quicker. Four years, my darling!
How long it seems!’</p>

<p>‘He will see the world,’ said Mrs Abbot, ‘and
learn that a pretty face is not everything.’</p>

<p>‘He will fall in and out of love with a
dozen girls before he returns,’ said Mr Abbot
cynically.</p>

<p>It has been before stated that for many years
there had been little change in either the possessions
or the position of the Abbots of Chewton-Abbot;
but, like other people, they had occasional
windfalls. Some years after Mr Abbot succeeded
to the estate, a new branch of a large railway
passed through an outlying part of his land, and
he who made it a boast of never selling or mortgaging
a single acre, was compelled, by the demands
of public convenience and commerce, to part with
what the railway wanted. Of course he obtained
a good round sum as compensation. This lay for
a long time at his banker’s, waiting for any contiguous
land which might come into the market.
After a while, as no fields which he wished to
add to his own were open to buyers, at his wife’s
suggestion he sought for another and more profitable
investment, and in an evil hour became the
proprietor of fifty shares in a bank, whose failure
has now become historical. He bought these
shares at a premium; whilst he held them, they
went to a much higher premium, but no doubt
the same tenacity which led him to cling to his
acres made him keep to the same investment.
The high rate of interest also was very useful,
and kept another horse or two in the stables.</p>

<p>We can all remember the astonishment we felt
that black day when the news of the stoppage of
that particular bank was flashed from end to end
of the kingdom, and how, afterwards, the exposure
of the reckless conduct of its directors, and of the
rotten state in which the concern had been for
years, sent a cold shudder down the back of every
holder of bank stock.</p>

<p>Mr Abbot was not a man of business. He did
not at once realise what being the registered owner
of these fifty shares meant. He denounced the
roguery of the directors, and vowed that if ever
again he had money to spare, into land it should
go, nowhere else. He had an idea that no more
than the money which he had invested would be
lost; but when, after a few days, he gathered from
the newspapers the true meaning of unlimited
liability, his heart grew sick within him. The
rental of his estate was about six thousand a
year; so, when call after call was made on the
shareholders, William Abbot knew that he was
a ruined man, and lamented his folly for not
having entailed the estates. Lands, house, furniture,
plate, all came to the hammer; and so
far as county people and landed gentry, the
Abbots were extinct. Mrs Abbot had a jointure
of some five hundred a year, on which the unfortunate
couple were fain to live as best they could.
They took a house at Weymouth, and in that
retired watering-place mourned their woes in
genteel obscurity.</p>

<p>So Frank Abbot came back from Switzerland
to begin the world on his own account, with
nothing but a college degree, a perfect constitution,
and a few hundred pounds scraped together
by the sale of his personal effects. How should
he earn his living? He was sorely tempted to
emigrate. He had the frame and muscles for
hard work, and outdoor life would suit him.
Yet he shrank from the idea of giving up as
beaten in his native land. Other men had made
their way; why should not he? He felt a consciousness
of a certain ability which necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">{297}</span>
might force into full play. His mother suggested
the church. ‘A clergyman of good family can
always marry a rich wife, and that you are
bound to do now.’ Frank shrugged his broad
shoulders, and thought sadly of his promised wife,
so many thousands of miles away. Eventually,
he decided to read for the bar. He knew it
would be slow and dreary work to win success
there—that for many years he must be prepared
to endure penury; but a career might be made.
If a hundred fail, one succeeds—why should he
not be that one?</p>

<p>Millicent must be told the bad news. He had
no right to keep a girl’s love during all the years
which must elapse before he could offer her a
home. He must at least release her from her vows.
If—and as he believed it would be—she refused
to be released, they must wait and hope. Now that
the reality of marrying on nothing came home
to him, he saw what it meant—what misery it
must entail. Now that the earning his own
living, of which he had spoken so bravely when
there was no need of his doing so, was forced upon
him, he became quite aware of the sacrifices he
must make. He was no desponding coward, and
indeed had little doubt as to his ultimate success.
He felt that he could bear hardship himself; but
he could not bear it if Millicent must also share
it. At anyrate it was right she should know
the change in his fortunes. So he wrote a few
words: ‘<span class="smcap">My Darling</span>—We are all ruined. I am
going to try and make a living as a barrister.
Of course I must now release you from every
promise.’ He signed his name; but before sealing
the letter, could not help adding: ‘But I love
you more than ever.’ Then he sent the letter to
Millicent’s aunt, and begged that it might be
forwarded to her niece.</p>

<p>That letter never reached its destination.
Whether it was mislaid or misdirected—whether
a mail-bag was lost either on the voyage or on
the long land journey—whether Miss Keene’s aunt,
who had learned what reverses had befallen the
Abbots, simply threw it on the fire, will never
be known. All that can be said is, Millicent
never received it; and after months had passed,
Frank, who was looking eagerly for the overdue
answer, grew very miserable, and began to doubt
the love of woman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Five long years have passed by. Frank Abbot
is now a barrister of nearly three years’ standing.
He works hard, is frequently on circuit, and if, as
yet, he has not achieved any brilliant forensic
triumph, he is neither briefless nor without hope.
Some small cases have been intrusted to him, and
he finds the number of these slowly but surely
increasing, and knows that if the opportunity
comes, and if, when it does come, he may be able
to seize it and make the most of it, success may soon
be his. Even now he makes enough to supply
the modest wants to which he has tutored himself.
But for some time after the last of his little capital
had vanished, he had been hardly pressed. Indeed,
in order to live at all, he had been compelled
to accept some aid from his parents’ reduced
means. They gave this readily enough, as, with
all their faults, they loved their son. Even to
this day, Frank looks back with a shudder upon
one or two years of his life.</p>

<p>The five years have changed him from a boy
to a man. He is handsome as ever, but his look
is more serious; his features express even more
character. He has given up all dreams of the
woolsack; but is conscious of possessing fair
abilities, a good address, a commanding presence,
and a great deal of ready self-confidence. He feels
that in a few years’ time he may have a home
to share, if the woman he loves is still willing
to share it. He has not again written to her. He
has heard nothing from her, although the time
by which he promised to claim her has long
passed. He is, however, resolved that as soon as
he sees the future fairly promising, he will seek
her, and learn whether she is still true to him; or
whether the sweetest episode of his life must be
linked with the memory of a woman’s faithlessness
and inconstancy. He sighs as he thinks of the
time which has elapsed since she waved him that
last farewell at Plymouth. ‘She may be married,
years ago,’ he says, ‘and have three or four
children by now.’ Then he thinks of her steadfast
eyes, and knows that he wrongs her—blames
himself for his mistrust. To sum up, Frank
Abbot’s constancy remains firm; but he is obliged
to do what thousands of other men must do,
hope for better days, working, meanwhile, with
might and main to bring the dawn of those better
days near.</p>

<p>Does he regret the loss of his fortune much?
Of course he does, being neither a fool nor of a
superhuman nature. Many a day, as he sits in
wig and gown in the stifling court, listening to
learned arguments on cases in which he has not
the remotest interest, his soul longs for a day
with the pheasants, a run with the Duke’s hounds,
or a ride round the home-farm; and he anathematises
all joint-stock banks as roundly as his father
may be supposed to have done. But, nevertheless,
Frank is not a soured man. He is somewhat
grave and self-contained, but pleasant company
enough to the few men whom he chooses to call
his friends.</p>

<p>He has not been near Chewton Hall since the
family downfall. It had been bought, with a
great part of the furniture, by a rich London
merchant, whose name, although he had heard
it at the time of the sale, had slipped from his
mind. Frank cared little who held it. He knew
it is only in romances that a ruined family
regains possession of its kingdom. Some day
he intended to run down and have a look at the
old place which he had loved so well; although
he feared the sight would not improve the tenor
of his mind, or make him less inclined to rail at
Fortune.</p>

<p>Just about this time Frank made a new
acquaintance. It was long vacation. The Lord
Chief-justice was yachting; his brother-judges,
Queen’s Counsel, and learned leaders, were recruiting
their jaded energies as it best pleased them;
gay juniors had thrown their wigs into their
boxes, and were away on various holiday pursuits.
Frank, however, who had recently succeeded in
getting some occasional work on a journal, and
who hoped to get more, was still in London.
One morning, a gentleman, who wished to see
Mr Abbot, was shown into his chambers. The
visitor was a tall middle-aged man, strongly built,
well dressed, and with pleasant features. He
looked like one who had led a hard life, and lines
on his brow told of trouble. His hands were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">{298}</span>
large and brown—it was evident they had not
been idle in their day. Not, perhaps, quite a
gentleman, as we conventionally use, or abuse,
that word, but a noticeable, out-of-the-common
man. He gave Frank a sharp quick glance, as if
trying to gauge his intellect and powers. Apparently
satisfied, he took the chair offered him, and
explained his errand. He had a lawsuit pending,
and wished Mr Abbot to conduct the case. Frank
interposed smilingly, and told his new client that
it was etiquette for his instructions to come
through a solicitor. He explained that a barrister
and the man whose cause he pleaded must communicate
through a third party. His visitor
apologised for his ignorance about such matters,
and said he would see his solicitor. However,
after the apology was accepted, instead of bowing
himself out, Mr John Jones—for by that name he
called himself—entered into a general kind of
conversation with Frank. He spoke easily and
pleasantly on a variety of topics, and when at
last he left the room, shook hands most cordially
with the young man, and hoped he should meet
him again soon.</p>

<p>‘Wonder who he is?’ said Frank, laughing over
the sudden friendliness this stranger had exhibited.
‘Anyway, I hope he’ll make his solicitors send
me that brief.’</p>

<p>However, no brief came; but for the next few
days Frank Abbot was always tumbling across
Mr John Jones. He met him in the street as he
went to and from his chambers. Mr Jones always
stopped him, shook hands, and as often as not,
turned and walked beside him. Frank began to
like the man. He was very amusing, and seemed
to know every country under the sun. Indeed,
he declared he was a greater stranger to London
than to any other capital. He was a great
smoker; and as soon as he found that Frank did
not object to the smell of good tobacco in his
chambers, scarcely a day went by without his
paying him a visit and having a long chat over
a cigar. Frank was bound to think that Mr
John Jones had taken a great liking to him.
Perhaps, the man wanted a friend. As he said,
he knew no one in London, and no one knew
him.</p>

<p>So young Abbot drifted into intimacy with
this lonely man, and soon quite looked forward
to the sound of his cheerful voice and the fragrance
of those particularly good cigars he smoked. He
even, at Mr Jones’ urgent request, ran down to
the seaside for a couple of days with him, and
found the time pass very pleasantly in his society.</p>

<p>Although the young man was very reticent
on the subject of his family’s misfortune, Mr
Jones had somehow arrived at the conclusion
that he was not rolling in wealth. He made no
secret of the fact that he himself was absurdly
rich. ‘I say, Abbot,’ he remarked one day, ‘if
you want any money to push yourself up with,
let me know.’ Perhaps Mr Jones fancied that
judgeships were to be bought.</p>

<p>‘I don’t want any,’ said Frank shortly.</p>

<p>‘Don’t take offence. I said, if you do. Your
pride—the worst part of you. It’s very hard a
man can only help a fellow like you by dying
and leaving him money. I don’t want to die
just yet.’</p>

<p>Frank laughed. ‘I want no money left me.
I shouldn’t take yours if you left it to me.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you’ll have to some day, you see.’
Then Mr John Jones lit another cigar from the
stump of the old one, and went his way; leaving
Frank more puzzled than ever with his new
friend.</p>

<p>But the next day an event occurred which
drove Mr John Jones, money, and everything
save one thing, out of his head: Millicent Keene
was in England—in London!</p>

<p>When he saw her letter lying on his table,
Frank Abbot feared it could not be real. It
would fade away like a fairy bank-note. No;
before him lay a few lines in her handwriting:
‘<span class="smcap">My dear Frank</span>—I have returned at last. I
am at No. 4 Caxton Place.—Yours, <span class="smcap">Millicent
Keene</span>.’</p>

<p>Early as it was, he rushed out of his office,
jumped into a cab, and sped away to the address
she gave him.</p>

<p>We may pass over the raptures, the embraces,
the renewed vows, the general delicious character
of that long-deferred meeting. We may suppose
the explanation of the lost letter accounting for
the girl’s silence; and we may picture her sympathy
with her lover’s misfortunes, and her approval
of the manly way in which he had gone to work
to retrieve them, in some degree. Let us imagine
them very very happy, sitting hand in hand in
a room at No. 4 Caxton Place; Millicent, by-the-by,
looking more beautiful than ever, her charms
not lessened by the look of joy in her dark
eyes.</p>

<p>Their first transports are over. They have
descended to mundane things. In fact, Frank
is now telling her that he believes he can count
on so many hundreds a year. What does his
darling think?</p>

<p>Miss Keene purses up her pretty mouth and
knits her brows. To judge by appearances, she
might be the most mercenary young woman.
Frank waits her reply anxiously.</p>

<p>‘I think we may manage,’ she says. ‘I have
been accustomed to poverty all my life, you
know.’</p>

<p>Frank would have vowed to work his fingers
to the bones before she should want anything;
but remembering just in time that his profession
worked with the tongue instead of the
hands, checked himself. He thanked her with
a kiss.</p>

<p>‘When shall we be married?’ he said.</p>

<p>She looked up at him shyly. ‘Would you
think it very dreadful if I said the sooner the
better? In fact, Frank, I have come from
Australia to marry you. If you had forgotten
me, I should have gone straight back.’</p>

<p>‘Next week?’ asked Frank, scarcely believing
his own happiness. ‘Will next week be too
soon? One advantage of being poor and living
in lodgings is, that we can be married without
any bother “about a house.”’</p>

<p>Millicent gave him to understand that next
week would do. She was staying with some
distant relative. No one’s consent had to be
asked. She had told her father all. The day
Frank chose, she would be his wife.</p>

<p>‘How is your father? I forgot to ask,’ said
Frank.</p>

<p>‘Much the same as ever,’ answered Millicent in
a way which inferred that Mr Keene’s struggles to
redeem fortune were as great as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">{299}</span></p>

<p>Then she dismissed Frank until to-morrow.
He went home walking on air, and, like a dutiful
son, wrote to Mrs Abbot, telling her that Millicent
had returned, and next week would marry him.
Mrs Abbot’s reply may be given here:</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Frank</span>—I <i>say</i> nothing. I am too
much <i>horrified</i>. If any young man was ever
called upon to marry money and build up the
fallen fortunes of a family, it is you. My last
hope is gone. The obstinacy of your character
I know too well. If I thought I could turn you
from your purpose, I would come and <i>kneel at
your feet</i>. If I knew Miss Keene’s address, I
would make one last appeal to her. She, I believe,
was a sensible young woman.—Your affectionate
<span class="smcap">Mother</span>.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COMMON_ERRORS_IN_DOMESTIC">COMMON ERRORS IN DOMESTIC
MEDICINE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">BY AN OLD PRACTITIONER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the various passions which are inherent
in the human breast, none is stronger or more
evident than the desire which every one manifests
to practise the healing art in some form or other,
either on himself or—more frequently—on his
fellow-creatures; a propensity which betrays itself
in the gratuitous administration of physic, the
infliction of minor surgery, or, if these suggestions
be not favourably received by the patient,
in copious advice of a hygienic nature. This is
particularly the case with the gentler sex. Every
woman is a physician at heart, and nothing is
more refreshing than to sit and listen to two
ladies in confidential medical conversation respecting
the merits of their favourite nostrums. It
is to them that homœopathy especially appeals.
What more delightful spectacle can be found than
that of a fair amateur ‘doctress’ with her book,
her case of phials and little gold spoon, dispensing
globules to her family, to her servants, to her
neighbours, to any one and every one; and to
enjoy at the same time the sweet reflection that
she is not doing a particle of harm! Nevertheless,
there are some not unfrequent mistakes in the
application of so-called household remedies, excellent
in themselves; and to call attention to these,
and to a few popular fallacies on the subject of
health and disease, is the object of the present
paper.</p>

<p>Let us commence with that finest of domestic
institutions, the poultice—bread, linseed, or mustard—soothing,
fomenting, or stimulating, according
to circumstances. There are few remedies in
the pharmacopœia of wider beneficial application
in surgery and medicine than this; yet terrible
mischief often follows its injudicious use. A man
has a cough, or his child wheezes with a ‘tightness
on the chest,’ and on goes a poultice straightway.
So far, so good; in all probability they wake
up next morning greatly relieved. But the father
is off to his daily business, and the child runs
about and plays as usual, while—since they feel
so much better—neither takes any precaution,
by extra clothing or otherwise, to guard against
the consequences of the poultice itself. The skin
and subjacent tissues have been rendered lax by
the heat and moisture, the blood-vessels are
dilated, and the circulation of the part increased;
to use a common expression, the ‘pores’ are open,
and there is thus a tenfold liability to catch cold,
especially in winter-time, when these things most
frequently happen. Ordinary colds which are
said to have ‘run’ into congestion of the lungs,
bronchitis, or pneumonia, may often be traced to
their serious or fatal termination through the
<i>undefended</i> use of a poultice.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that a common
poultice—such as is made of linseed meal or bread—is
merely a vehicle for the application of damp
heat—a continuous fomentation, in fact—and has
no specific curative action. A muslin bag filled
with bran, or flannels dipped in hot water, have
precisely the same effect, but are not so conveniently
employed, as they have to be more
frequently renewed. A poultice should always
be thoroughly mixed and homogeneous in consistence
throughout; just so wet as to permit of
its retaining the mould of the cup when turned
out, but not wet enough to exude water by its
own weight when lightly applied. A <i>hot</i> poultice
should never be allowed to remain on after its
outer part is less than the temperature of the
blood, nor must it get dry and caked. As a
general rule, it may be said that bread makes a
better cataplasm than linseed meal, but requires
to be changed oftener. There are, of course,
special medical reasons in occasional cases for the
preference of one or the other, but such instances
scarcely come within the scope of this article.
Well-mashed carrots make a capital soothing
application, and a poultice composed of tea-leaves
is, owing to its slight astringent action, generally
suitable when one is required about the region
of the eye. An abominable mixture of soap and
sugar is very popular as a local remedy in some
parts of England, and is credited with great
‘drawing’ properties. On the other hand, it is
good to know that the old-fashioned liniment of
hartshorn and oil is one of the best embrocations
ever invented under ordinary circumstances, and
that therapeutical research amongst all the drugs
that the vegetable and mineral kingdoms afford
has never discovered an improvement on salt and
water as a gargle for simple sore throat.</p>

<p>What British home would <i>be</i> a home without
its little roll of sticking or court plaster? How
often is it that little tearful eyes look mistily
down on a poor scratched finger, held carefully
out in the other hand, as if there were some
danger of its coming off, while mamma cuts a
thin yellow strip and wraps it round the injured
member with comforting words, all lamentation
being temporarily reduced to an occasional sob
in the interest of the operation. That the
sticking-plaster exercises a fine moral effect in
such a case, there can be no doubt; but I fear
there is as little doubt that it often does more
harm than good from a physical point of view,
and this arises from the fallacious belief in it as a
healing agent. The only real service that sticking-plaster
does is to hold two cut surfaces together
while Nature’s process necessary for their union
is being completed, acting for a slight wound as
stitches do in a deep one. But to cover an abrasion
or raw surface with it is worse than useless, as it
only irritates it. The plea is often advanced that
it serves to keep dust and dirt off. A bit of wet
linen rag, however, would be far better for that
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">{300}</span></p>

<p>Most of the ordinary household cures for
chilblains are well enough in their way, but an
unfortunate mistake is often committed in applying
certain of them, which are fit only for the
chilblains in their early stage, to broken ones,
setting up thereby great inflammation and producing
very painful sores. A broken chilblain
is a little ulcer, and must be treated as such.
As for the thousand-and-one remedies in vogue
for corns, it is wonderful that they should exist
at all, since nine people out of ten could cure
their own without any application whatever, by
wearing properly fitting boots and shoes. It is
irregularity of pressure which creates corns; boots
which are too big being as productive of the
tiny torments as tight ones. A wet rag covered
with oiled silk—to retain the moisture—and
bound round the corn, is one of the best
cures.</p>

<p>A very common but reprehensible practice is
that of holding a burn as close to the grate as
possible, ‘to draw the fire out’—not out of the
fireplace—but from the injured part. It is
quite feasible to conceive that such a proceeding
may give ease by deadening sensation in some
instances; but it by no means follows that it
does good or expedites recovery—indeed, we
shall see that in such a case the loss of
sensation really proves further damage to the
tissues. Burns have been divided by surgeons
into six classes: (1) Simple scorching, sufficient
only to redden the surface. (2) Blistering; the
cuticle raised and forming little bladders of water.
(3) The skin denuded of its cuticle. This is the
most painful stage of all, as it leaves the nerve-ends
exposed. (4) Destruction of the entire
thickness of the skin; painless or nearly so,
because the sensitive nerve-bulbs are destroyed.
(5) Destruction of all the soft parts; and (6)
charring of the bone—two conditions very difficult
to imagine as co-existent with any remnant of
life. It can thus be readily understood how a
burn of the third order of magnitude can be
converted by additional heat into the fourth, and
temporary relief from pain purchased by transforming
a trifling injury into a serious one, liable
to be followed by severe illness and permanent
deformity. A most mysterious cause of death
after burns is the ulceration and bursting of a
certain blood-vessel in the stomach. The connection
between the two has never been discovered.
People talk about this or that being good for a
burn, but not for a scald, or <i>vice versâ</i>; but
practically no distinction is to be drawn between
the two, further than that, as we know the
highest temperature of water, we know the utmost
limit of injury in a scald, whereas there is no
limit to the possibilities of a burn. To keep the
air from both is the main object in treatment.
Cook, who generally appears on the scene of the
disaster with her flour-dredge, is a very efficient
surgeon for burns and scalds of the first degree—this
little scientific technicality will comfort the
sufferer marvellously; but where the skin is
raised or broken, something of an oily nature—Carron
oil, for instance—should be substituted.
Cover it up with lots of cotton-wool, as though
you wished to keep it as warm as possible; and,
mind, no soap and sugar on any account!</p>

<p>What is the origin of the popular idea that
the finger-nails are poisonous to a wound? It
does not do a wound much good to scratch it,
or indeed touch it, but that is no reason why
those useful little shields of our finger-ends should
be so libelled. Whence comes the notion that
to pierce a girl’s ears and compel her to wear
earrings improves her eyesight? Possibly this
may have arisen from the fact that medical
men sometimes put blisters behind the ears as
counter-irritants, to relieve some chronic ophthalmic
disorders. Why is a glass of hot rum-and-water
with a lump of butter in it not only
familiarly prescribed for but familiarly swallowed
by catarrh-afflicted mankind? Speaking of colds
generally, we may remark in passing that treacle
posset, hot gruel, putting the feet in mustard-and-water,
&amp;c., are all capital things, but that
they effect only the one object of inducing
perspiration. There is nothing specifically curative
about any of them. It is a mistake, however,
to give spirits, negus, or any alcoholic fluids in
influenza colds where there is much congestion
of the mucous membranes, as it increases the
incidental headache.</p>

<p>Some people fancy that a magnet will draw
out a needle, broken off short in the hand, even
when it has passed in altogether out of sight.
When a medical practitioner is called upon to
extract a broken needle, he usually finds that
it has been driven beyond reach by injudicious
squeezing and other futile home-attempts at
extraction, for the lightest touch makes a needle
travel. A very troublesome class of case this
is, owing to the uncertainty of its exact situation,
of the direction of its long axis, and of its even
being there at all—each sufficient to create the
disagreeable possibility of cutting into the flesh
without finding it. In such a state of affairs,
one might as well put a magnet in the mouth
to draw one’s boots on, as to expect to extract
the needle by its influence. But a celebrated
surgeon, Mr Marshall, has devised an ingenious
application of this force for the purpose of
detection. A powerful magnet is held upon the
part which contains the suspected needle for some
time, so as to influence it. Then a finely-hung
polarised needle is suspended over it, and is
immediately deflected, if any metal be concealed
beneath. Never press or squeeze the flesh about
a broken needle or bit of glass. If you cannot
lay hold of it with the fingers or scissors, or,
still better, a pair of tweezers, and pull it right
out at once, keep quite still until a doctor has
seen it. By so doing, you may save yourself
weeks or months of pain, and even possible
amputation of a limb.</p>

<p>Tea if taken in excess is indigestible and nerve-destroying;
but in sickness this delightful fluid
gives a temporary stimulus to the brain, and
though possessing no feeding qualities in itself,
it prevents or retards the waste of tissue—a property
of considerable importance in illness where
but little food is taken. Above all, the fact of
being allowed one favourite beverage, albeit
greatly diluted, when everything else that pertains
to the routine of daily life seems interdicted or
upset, has a beneficial effect on the patient, who
welcomes his cup of weak tea with something
of the anticipation of that refreshment and social
enjoyment he derives from it under brighter
circumstances.</p>

<p>‘Is the bone broken, or only fractured, doctor?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">{301}</span>
is an anxious question often asked apropos of an
injured limb. Broken and fractured are synonymous
terms in surgery, my dear madam—it is
always a lady who asks this—but I think I know
what you mean. A fully developed bone is rarely
cracked—nearly always it snaps in two pieces—but
the soft cartilaginous bones of children
sometimes sustain what is called a ‘green-stick
fracture,’ a name which almost explains itself,
meaning that the bone is broken through part
of its thickness, but not separated, as happens with
the green bough of a tree. Many people have a
totally erroneous idea, when an arm or leg is badly
bruised only, that it would be better if it were
broken. ‘Right across the muscle, too!’ implies
that an injury has been received across the upper
arm in the region of the biceps, that being the
only ‘muscle’ which is honoured by general
public recognition. How many people know that
what they call their flesh, and the lean part of
meat, is nothing but muscles, the pulleys by which
every action of the body is performed? Common
mistakes lie in trying to ‘walk off’ rheumatism,
sprains, and other things which should be kept
entirely at rest; and in squeezing collections
of matter which have burst or been lanced, with
a view to hasten their healing by the more speedy
emptying of their contents.</p>

<p>Of late years, the Latin or other scientific
equivalents for diseases have crept into general
use, with the curious result that in many cases
they are taken to mean different things. Scarlatina,
for instance, not only sounds much nicer than
scarlet fever, but is often considered to be that
disease in a milder form; and the identity of
pneumonia with inflammation of the lungs, or
of gastric with typhoid fever, or of the various
terms ending in ‘itis’ with the inflammation they
are intended to specify, is far from being universally
recognised. Abscess is a better word
than ‘gathering;’ and though, on the other hand,
‘tumour’ seems very dreadful, we may find
consolation in remembering that after all it only
means a swelling, whatever the nature may be,
from a gum-boil to a cancer. There is much
in a name. Dipsomania sounds much better than
the other thing; and kleptomania by any other
name would not smell so sweet. Much in a name?
I should think so. Read what follows, if you
doubt it. When a ship arrives in an English
port from abroad, before those on board are
allowed to have any communication with the
shore, the ship must be declared healthy by the
sanitary authorities, who accordingly board her at
once, inspect her bills of health, and especially
the list of those who have been ill during the
voyage. If any of these are entered on the sick-list
as having suffered from intermittent fever,
printed forms have to be filled up, declarations
made and signed, certificates written out, all sorts
of questions answered about whether their bedding
or clothing has been destroyed; and the men
themselves paraded on deck for inspection. But
if it is stated, instead, that they have suffered
from ague—only another word for intermittent
fever—then no notice is taken of it!</p>

<p>After all, there is very little rationale in any
amateur system of medicine; all its treatment is
purely empirical, and has its root in that love of
mysticism which prevails in everything. Medicine,
like every other science, is built up of hard,
unromantic facts, amenable to the laws of logic
and common-sense. The popular idea runs always
on specifics. Every bottle in a druggist’s shop
is supposed to contain a definite remedy for
a definite disease; and the patient weaving
of link with link in a chain of logical inferences,
of the correlation of causes and effects,
which constitutes medical science, is unknown.
‘What’s good for so-and-so?’ is a query constantly
put to a doctor; and if he answers
honestly, he must confess that in nine cases out
of ten he can give no absolute reply, but must
preface his words with, ‘That depends!’ Take
two very frequent illustrations by way of conclusion.
What is ‘good for’ indigestion? and what
for a headache? But what is indigestion? Not
a disease, but a generic name for fifty different
diseases, all attended with the same symptoms in
some measure, but proceeding from not only
different but often entirely opposite causes. Thus,
the pain may be produced by a deficiency or
by an excess of the gastric juice; and by any
derangement, from a simple error in diet to a
cancer; and it requires the practised eye, ear,
and hand of the physician to detect and appreciate
those minute differences which point to the root
of the evil. As for a headache, such a complaint
hardly exists <i>per se</i>, but is almost invariably a
symptom only of some other disorder; and we all
know how many varying states of the body will
give us headache. Nevertheless, may the practice
of domestic medicine and the virtues which go
with it long continue in our midst, and let no
man be so ill-advised as to banish the harmless
little medicine-chest with its associations from his
hearth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OUTWARD_AND_HOMEWARD_BOUND">OUTWARD AND HOMEWARD BOUND.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> a long journey by sea and land, in fair
weather and in foul, has fallen to my lot; but
to none can I look back with such vivid delight
as to the first which found me turning from
wintry England to seek a perpetual summer
beneath Eastern skies.</p>

<p>I fancy every one’s first voyage by one of
the P. and O. steam-packets must be a matter
of considerable amusement, from the novelty
of everything. Perhaps one of the most curious
sights is the coming on board of the Indian
and Colonial mails. It seems scarcely possible
that such a multitude of boxes and sacks as
those which lie heaped up in such solid masses
can really be all postal matter. A very great
man on board is the guardian of Her Majesty’s
mails. A man of wondrous authority—occasionally
a thorn in the side of the captain, as
being the possessor of certain powers of interference
or of counsel, rarely, however, brought
into action. Then as to fellow-passengers, there
is no type of man, woman, or child who is not
here represented. Happily, when outward bound,
the proportion of children is very small. The
return voyage is very different. Perhaps ninety
or a hundred children of all sizes and ages,
flying from oriental climates, in which young
English life cannot flourish, and all more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">{302}</span>
spoilt by the care of ayahs and native servants,
whose sole idea of training is to give a child
whatever it cries for. Imagine the torture which
must be inflicted by such an army of babies on
the older passengers, probably never, at the best,
much addicted to babiolatry, but now rendered
doubly irritable by long battles with sun and
liver; for on a voyage homeward there are
generally a sad proportion of sickly folk; men
conscious of possessing a liver, and all manner of
other complaints, or, worse still, unconscious alike
of life’s cares or pleasures. On our return to
England, there were no less than twelve lunatics
on board, victims of the combined influence of
the sun and the system of incessant ‘pegs,’ alias
brandy and soda-water.</p>

<p>Outward bound, we find abundant studies of
character in ship-life, where business is laid aside,
and in general every one tries to make the best of
his neighbours. From the grave old Indian
official, returning to his high post in some distant
corner of the empire, down to the beardless
Competition Wallah, still breathless from the
educational high-pressure to which he has been
subjected, all minds are naturally more or less
tinged with thoughts of the land for which they
are bound; and we hear more of Indian and Colonial
manners and customs than we should do
in a year in Britain. A considerable number of
the more energetic set to work at once to learn
Hindustani or some other oriental language—generally
a fruitless struggle, as only an exceptional
few, with wondrous powers of abstraction,
can find leisure for any settled work.</p>

<p>Among the small novelties which catch the
unaccustomed eye, is the setting of a great
dinner-table in stormy weather. The table from
end to end is covered with skeleton frames of
mahogany, laid over the tablecloth. These are
called ‘fiddles,’ and keep your plate from rolling
too far. As to your cup or wine-glass, it stands
on a swinging table opposite your nose, and
preserves so perfect an equilibrium, that in the
wildest storm, not one drop of the contents is
spilt. How the stewards manage to wait, and the
cooks to cook, for such a multitude, in such a
rolling and turmoil, and in such limited space, is
a matter for perpetual wonder and admiration.
If you go for’ard, you will find a regular town—butcher’s
shop and baker’s shop, carpenter’s shop
and engineer’s shop, tailors and laundrymen—that
is, sailors doing amateur work; and as to the live-stock,
there are sheep and pigs, and cows and
oxen, and poultry of every description; in short,
a regular farmyard; and I think some of the big
children find as much amusement as the little
ones in that corner of the ship.</p>

<p>One thing startling to a new traveller is the
rapidity with which time changes. He finds his
watch going very wrong, and perhaps, for the
first day or two, is weak enough to alter it, till he
finds it simpler to count ‘bells’ after the manner
of the sea. Speaking of hours, one of the many
small gambling devices to relieve the tedium
of the voyage is a system of sweepstakes as to
the exact moment when the vessel will drop
anchor at any given port, tickets being issued
for every five or ten minutes of the expected
forenoon or afternoon, and the winnings being
sometimes presented to a Sailors’ Orphan Fund.
Some of my fellow-travellers have told me that
in long weary voyages they had been driven to
institute races for short distances, the steeds
being cheese-mites, or maggots carefully extracted
from the nuts. These races at last became
positively exciting; and the same creatures being
preserved from day to day, were, if of approved
speed, worth small fortunes to their owners. A
very swift maggot would sell for a large sum!
Fly loo was another favourite game, but happily,
we have never had occasion to try such singular
amusements. There are games at Bull for those
who want exercise; and sedentary games and
books, and singing and chatting, for sociable folk.
For my part, being an unsocial sort of animal,
I think that ‘to be talked to all day’ is the sum
of human misery, as much on board ship as on
land. So, on my memorable first voyage, when
all was new and delightful, I soon discovered a
quiet nook on the top of the deck cabin, right
astern, where, with infinite satisfaction, I established
myself, and there read in peace, no one
venturing to invade that haven of refuge save
under a solemn vow of silence. But when the
light began to wane, the silence was no more;
for the sons and daughters of music there
assembled, and as there were several good voices
and a first-rate leader, the glees and choruses
were sometimes very effective.</p>

<p>Thus pleasantly day and night slipped by
in quick succession. Casual acquaintanceships
ripened into lifelong friendships; and when at
length we reached our journey’s end, the joy
of arrival was tempered by true regret for the
break-up of a pleasant party, and the dispersion
of many friends, of whom the majority in all
probability might never meet again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A brief year passed away—a year of ever-changing
delight in the wondrous Indian land,
and ere we realised that our allotted twelve months
were over, we found ourselves numbered with
<i>The Homeward Bound</i>. Very different was our
return journey from the last. Instead of finding
ourselves surrounded by a superabundance of
bright energetic life, our companions were almost
all on the sick-list, as few people who were not
driven home by illness, would exchange an Indian
winter for the chilly frosts and snows of England.
Instead of the continuous sunshine of our outward
journey, we had bitter winds and sharp storms,
and though we were too good sailors to be thereby
affected, some of our neighbours were wretched
enough.</p>

<p>But the saddest change of all was the long list
of funerals, which, commencing ere we left the
deep-blue Indian Ocean, only ended as we
neared the English shores. Sometimes we heard
the beautiful words of the solemn funeral service
read in the quiet moonlight, and sometimes when
we could scarcely distinguish a word for the
howling of the storm and roar of waters, and
only knew by the sad, earnest faces of sailors and
soldiers crowding round, that the uncoffined clay,
which lay so still beneath the outspread Union-jack,
was about to be committed to the deep.
The first who thus ‘fell asleep’ was a little child,
on whom the tropical sun had laid its fiery finger.
Not all the ice of Himla could cool the burning
of that fevered, throbbing brow; and the wistful
baby-eyes looked vainly up, in piteous mute
appeal, to those who knew too bitterly how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">{303}</span>
utterly powerless they were to help. But when the
red glowing sun sank below the mellow waters,
that tender spirit rose to its Home, far beyond
the stars; and loving hands laid the tiny marble
form in a pure white shell, meet for so fair a
pearl. Then kind, warm-hearted British tars
covered that little coffin with England’s flag,
and laid it down gently and reverently, standing
round bareheaded in the warm southern moonlight,
while holy words were uttered as the
little white coffin sank down into the quiet depths
of that wondrously blue sea.</p>

<p>A few more days went by, and again the Angel
of Death was among us. This time he came to
call away a poor fellow with the frame of a
young giant, who but a few months before had
left the Emerald Isle in glowing health and
strength, but who now wearily dragged himself
along sun-stricken, utterly unconscious that the
shadow of the angel’s wing already darkened
over him; only craving once more to reach the
old home, where mother and sisters would welcome
him. But when the sun rose, one cold, bleak
morning, we were told he had passed away in
the night. We were on the Red Sea; but it was
bitterly cold and stormy, and the dull, drear,
wintry winds were echoing over bleak bare shores,
and sighing among the masts and rigging. Even
the sea was leaden-hued; and when the funeral
service was read, and the body lowered into the
sullen waves, the pale sunrise was overclouded
by a heavy drifting shower. It was the saddest,
dreariest funeral at which I was ever present. In
the cabin next to his was another victim of the
sun—a handsome young bride, with mind, alas!
all unstrung. Of course she could not have known
what was passing so near, yet, through all those
sad hours she kept on crooning a low plaintive
song, telling how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Somebody’s darling, so young, and so fair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Somebody’s darling lay dying there.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An hour later we lay-to, off the wreck of the
ill-fated <i>Carnatic</i>, the property of the same Company
as the ship in which we sailed; which,
but a few weeks previously, had, one Sunday night,
in calmest weather, diverged but a little from her
course, and struck upon a hidden coral reef.
There she lay all the long day in the sunshine.
So little was danger suspected, that not even Her
Majesty’s mails, or the precious human lives on
board, were landed on the island of Shadwan,
which lay at a distance of about three miles;
and where all might have found a safe refuge.
Meals continued to be served with the usual wonderful
regularity; and between whiles, the passengers
amused themselves with angling for fish
of dazzling colours, which swarmed all round the
coral rock. In short, the affair seems to have
been treated in the light of a summer picnic,
till the dread moment when, at midnight, the
vessel suddenly parted mid-ships and went down.
Thus, like another <i>Royal George</i>, the good ship
suddenly foundered in a calm sea, carrying
with her many a brave British heart. Some
good swimmers, though carried down with the
swirl, struggled to the surface, and after many
a hard blow from floating spars and luggage,
escaped with their lives; and a few boats likewise
got beyond the reach of the whirlpool. It was
Tuesday night before the survivors were all safe
on the isle of Shadwan; and of their goods, only
one dressing-bag and one dry box of matches had
escaped. Some huge bales of dry cotton had, however,
been cast ashore, so tightly packed that the
centre was still quite dry. This they heaped up
as material for a bonfire, wherewith to greet the
first sail that hove in sight; and while some stood
by, ready to kindle the blaze, others rowed out
to sea again, taking with them their only rocket.
They had not long to wait. Soon a great steamer
belonging to the same Company drew near, and
the Homeward-bound rescued the survivors of the
Outward-bound, whose journey sunward had been
thus sadly damped at the outset. All we saw of
the wreck were the extreme tips of the masts
appearing above the waters, to mark where the
divers were even then at work, seeking to rescue
property of all sorts. The mails had previously
been rescued, and many half-legible letters had
reached India before we had sailed thence.</p>

<p>Strangely, in truth, fell our Christmas Eve,
as we landed, on the dull shore of Suez, where,
on a little sandy island, so many of England’s
sons, ‘homeward-bound,’ sleep their last sleep
beneath the burning sun; and as we stood in
the starlight, watching the last of our companions
hurrying on to Alexandria, it was hard indeed
to realise that festive Yule had found us in such
dreary quarters. Nor—for it was before the
Suez Canal days—did it mend matters much
to spend our Christmas Day whirling across the
Desert in an Egyptian railway. But when evening
brought us to the green banks of the Nile,
we were content.</p>

<h3>WHY DO WE NOW DRINK LESS COFFEE?</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> many years past it has been plainly
apparent that there has been a decline in the consumption
of coffee; and while the use of spirits,
wine, tobacco, tea, and cocoa has considerably
increased, that of coffee has fallen off to a considerable
extent. Dr Wallace, F.R.S.E., in a paper read
before the Society of Public Analysts, is of opinion
that the people of this country are losing their
taste for coffee because of the difficulty of obtaining
it in a pure state. About the time when the
consumption per head was highest, coffee began
to be adulterated with chicory, and now this is
done so universally, that many people prefer the
mixture to pure coffee, and few know the taste of
the genuine article.</p>

<p>When travelling on the continent, the tourist
enjoys the fragrant cup; but the beverage supplied
at the best hotels and restaurants in this
country is not coffee, but a mixture of that
substance with chicory, in the proportion of
three-fourths to one-third of the whole, and
sometimes more. As Dr Wallace correctly says,
this substance may be described as chicory
flavoured with coffee. Chicory being bitter, with
three times the colouring power of coffee, gives
it the appearance of great strength; but it should
always be remembered that it contains no caffeine,
and wants the exhilarating qualities for which
good coffee is partaken. The sooner the public
awakens to a sense of this fact, the better.</p>

<p>Pure coffee can be had; but it is only sold
with a grudge, for the grocer has his chief profit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">{304}</span>
in the chicory with which it is adulterated. To
show where the profit lies, take the case of a
particular coffee sold in tins, which contains one
part of coffee to three parts of chicory, and is
sold at one-and-fourpence per pound. The coffee
in a pound of it costs, retail, say sevenpence, the
chicory, say fourpence, tins, say threepence, profit
twopence—total, one-and-fourpence. But the
purchaser gets no value except the sevenpenceworth
of coffee, the chicory only adding colour,
bitterness, and body, so that he pays one-and-fourpence
for sevenpenceworth of coffee.</p>

<p>Amongst the other substances used to adulterate
coffee in order to yield a higher profit to the
dealer, are burnt sugar or caramel, dried and
roasted figs, dried dates, date-stones, decayed ships’
biscuits, beans, peas, acorns, malt, dandelion root,
turnips, carrots, parsnips, and mangold-wurzel,
all of which are roasted in imitation of coffee.
There is little wonder, therefore, that coffee,
which lends itself so easily to unprincipled
adulteration, is becoming unpopular. According
to Dr Wallace, the quantity used per head in
1843 was 1.1 lb., increasing up to 1848, when it
was 1.37 lb. It has since slowly but steadily
declined, especially since 1853, and is now only
.89 lb.; a decrease since 1843 of nineteen per cent.,
and since 1853 of fifty-four per cent. About
five pounds of tea per head are consumed to one
of coffee. In France, with a heavier duty, the
consumption of coffee is 3.23 lbs. a head; Germany
and Holland, 5.3 lbs.; Switzerland, 6.68 lbs.;
Italy, only 1.05 lb.; while Belgium is largest of
all, being 9 lbs. a head. The total consumption
in Europe is about four hundred thousand
tons, of which Great Britain used fourteen
thousand tons in 1880. In the same year,
about six thousand tons of chicory were retained
for home consumption, which is an index to the
extent of the adulteration. When the public
taste ceases to lend itself to coffee adulterated
with chicory and other rubbish, and when folks
have acquired the art of making it properly,
then the beverage might take the high place
in general estimation to which it is justly
entitled.</p>


<h3>ABNORMAL HUMANITY.</h3>

<p>A new phenomenon has lately appeared in
Paris in the shape of a man with a head resembling
that of a calf. The similarity is said to be
wonderful. For his own sake, it is to be hoped
that this eccentric-looking person will prove
as great a financial success as his three recent
celebrated predecessors—the Man-frog, the man
with a goose’s head, and the Man-dog, who have
all retired into private life, having made a nice
little fortune. The Man-frog was first exhibited
in 1866, at a French country fête. He had a
stout ill-shapen body, covered with a skin like
a leather bottle, and a face exactly like a frog’s,
large eyes, an enormous mouth, and the skin cold
and clammy. He attracted a good deal of attention
from the Academy of Medicine, and a delegate
was deputed to make him an object of study. He
went all over France; and at the end of a few
years, retired to his native place, Puyre, in
Gers.</p>

<p>The man with the goose’s head was first shown
at the Gingerbread Fair in 1872. He was twenty
years of age, had round eyes, a long and flat nose
the shape and size of a goose’s bill, an immensely
long neck, and was without a single hair on his
head. He only wanted feathers to make him
complete. The effect of his interminably long
neck twisting about was extremely ludicrous, and
was so much appreciated, that his receipts were
very large. He now passes under his proper name
of Jean Rondier, and is established at Dijon as
a photographer. He is married; and, thanks to
enormously high collars and a wig, is now tolerably
presentable.</p>

<p>The Man-dog came from Russia, and was for
a long time exhibited in Paris. He is now settled
at Pesth, having established a bird-fancier’s business
there, which is decidedly flourishing.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
